# Notes App

An app for taking notes and saving them to localStorage. Uses markdown and can convert it to HTML.

## About

Code for the notes app project of Scrimba's Learn React for Free course.

Most of the code was provided by the course. My code begins with this [commit](https://github.com/AndrewHuntington/notes-app/commit/6961ad3987be8e3d560f67e39a0ee135d9c46a6d).
